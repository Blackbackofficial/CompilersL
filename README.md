# Compilers Labs
### Lab 1.
1. Based on a regular expression, builds an NFA.
2. Based on the NFA, builds an equivalent DFA.
3. Based on the DFA, constructs an equivalent FA that has the least possible number of states.
    Instruction. Use the algorithm given at
    http://neerc.ifmo.ru/wiki/index.php?title=Brzhozovsky_Algorithm
4. Models the minimum CA for the input string from the terminals of the original grammar.
